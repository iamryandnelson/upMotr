                    <p>Every single new day gives us an opportunity to do something that we enjoy. Whether you’re into the outdoors, spending time with friends and family, or relaxing with a book - everybody has something that makes them happy. And for most of the driving population, there’s nothing better than getting into a new (or new to you) vehicle.</p>
                    <p>Of course, not everyone is inclined to switch vehicles frequently and might hesitate even if it’s something they’ve been thinking about. Sometimes all you need is that little push to help you make the right decision. Here are ten great reasons to buy a new car.</p>
                    <h6>1. Raise</h6>
                    <p>A raise at work is always a great reason to buy a new car. You’ve worked hard and are being rewarded for it, so reward yourself too. Maybe you’ve been thinking about getting a vehicle with more luxury features for a while, or maybe you want to get into an SUV. Whatever you’ve been dreaming about, if you’re making more money at work then you’ve literally earned it.</p>
                    <h6>2. Technology</h6>
                    <p>The technology on cars gets more and more advanced every year, and going from a car that’s over five years old to a new (or newer) car can make a huge difference in the types of features you have access to. From advanced media options to self-parking features, new technology can make driving a car feel like an entirely futuristic experience.
                    </p>
                    <h6>3. Job</h6>
                    <p>Tens of millions of people use their vehicles for work and in many cases not just any car will do. The great thing about this is that you can usually write off a lot of your vehicle expenses on your taxes. Whether you need a rugged work truck, a luxurious car to project success for client meetings, or just a fuel-efficient compact for long trips, a job is logical and common reason for buying a car.</p>
                    <h6>4. Reliability</h6>
                    <p>When we’re younger, we don’t really think about reliability as an important thing. But the older we get, the more we value reliability, usually after having experienced a breakdown on the side of the road, or persistent nagging vehicle issues. If you don’t trust your car to start every morning, or make it through another year without issues, it’s probably time to buy a new one.</p>
                    <h6>5. More Room</h6>
                    <p>Requiring a more roomy vehicle is a very common (and good) reason for getting a new ride. Your family might be growing and you need to fit a child safety seat in the back, or you’ve realized that your sedan isn’t big enough to transport all of the stuff you buy from yard sales on the weekends. Whatever the reason, more room means it’s time to look for something bigger.</p>
                    <h6>6. Life Changes</h6>
                    <p>We all go through life changes as we get older. Marriages, divorces, promotions, moves, mid-life crises, pet adoptions all could mean that a new car is needed. In fact, if you’re at a point where you’re “starting over” for whatever reason, a car is a great symbolic way to say goodbye to the past and start fresh.</p>
                    <h6>7. Gas Mileage</h6>
                    <p>Sometimes owning a sports car or a big truck might make you realize that you have too much car for your needs. If that’s the case then something more fuel-efficient will peak your interest. Even though bigger vehicles have better fuel economy than ever these days due to technological advancements, buying something with better gas mileage is always a great reason to your ride in for something new.</p>
                    <h6>8. Safety Features</h6>
                    <p>Like gas mileage, safety features have come a long way in the last few decades and every year cars get safer and safer. If you’re concerned with finding a safer vehicle for your family, or if vehicle safety is just something that is becoming more of a concern for you then you should definitely look at new or newer cars, whose designer have put countless hours of energy and innovation into keeping you safer.</p>
                    <h6>9. Power</h6>
                    <p>Some people need more power to tow things like boats or trailers, while others simply want to be able to feel more when they step on the gas. In either case, buying a car with more power rarely leaves a person feeling any regret when they drive it off the lot. You’d be hard pressed to find too many people who want a car that has less power, although it does happen from time to time.</p>
                    <h6>10. Treat Yourself</h6>
                    <p>Let’s face it, an overwhelming number of people who buy vehicles do it because they simply want to. We live in a world where there are new and amazing cars being designed and released every year from many different brands, so there’s bound to be at least one or two that you can fall in love with. If you want something new or different, treat yourself and just do it.</p>
